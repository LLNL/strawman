# at some sites ssl certs are intercepted, which cases issues fetching 
# tpl sources via https

# to resolve this, either:
# 1) pass the "-k" option to uberenv (recommended), 
# 2) install the proper certs into the image, or
# 3) use  the following commands to disable ssl for git and 
#    curl (both are used by spack):
#RUN git config --global http.sslVerify false
#RUN echo insecure >> ~/.curlrc

# bootstrap third party libs using spack and uberenv
#  for this example we use mpich for MPI
