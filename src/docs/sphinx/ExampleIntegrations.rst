Example Integrations
--------------------
Strawman comes with three example integrations:

  - Lulesh: a lagrangian shock hydrodynamics code 
  - Kripke: a deterministic neutron transport code
  - CloverLeaf3D: an eulerian hydrodynamics code

.. note::
  All three example codes use both MPI and OpenMP for hybrid parallelism.

Lulesh
^^^^^^

Lulesh is a proxy-application for LLNL's production ALE3D code. 
Lulesh in programmed in C++ and uses an unstructured mesh. 
More information about Lulesh can be found at `https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php <https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php>`_.

The Strawman integration can be found in two locations.
Lulesh's mesh description can be found at line 189 in ``/src/examples/proxies/lulesh2.0.3/lulesh-init.cc``, and the Strawman API usage can be found in the simulations main loop beginning at line 2769 in the file ``/src/examples/proxies/lulesh2.0.3/lulesh.cc``.

Running Lulesh
""""""""""""""
Strawman will create two versions of lulesh, one serial and one MPI parallel, but both versions are capable of using OpenMP.
Lulesh takes several command line arguments, but the most useful are:
  
  - ``-p`` prints the progress of the solver as the simulation progresses
  - ``-i {number of iterations}`` how many iterations to run the simulation. Note: this is not a guarantee, since Lulesh has other termination criteria.  
  - ``-s {per node problem size}`` defines the problem size to run on each node. The larger the value, the longer the times steps will be take to calculate

.. note::
  When running lulesh in parallel, the number of MPI processes must be a perfect cube. For example, some valid numbers of MPI tasks would be 1, 2, 8, and 27.

The command below would launch Lulesh for 10 iterations with a problem size of 32^3 zones per node (8*32^3 = 262,144 total zones):

.. code-block:: bash

  srun -n 8 lulesh_par -i 10 -s 32

CloverLeaf3D
^^^^^^^^^^^^
CloverLeaf3D is a proxy-application from the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) that can be found at `http://uk-max.github.io/CloverLeaf3D <http://uk-max.github.io/CloverLeaf3D>`_.
CloverLeaf is written in Fortran90.
The data integration can be found in the file ``src/examples/proxies/cloverleaf3d-ref/visit.F90``, and the Strawman API in the main loop can be found at ``src/examples/proxies/cloverleaf3d-ref/hydro.F90`` starting at line 46.
CloverLeaf3D uses ghost zones, thus they have to be stripped each time step before being passed to Strawman.

Running CloverLeaf3D
""""""""""""""""""""
Unlike the other two example integrations, CloverLeaf3D uses an input deck to describe the problem setup.
There are a number of example problems in the CloverLeaf3D source directory, and one (`clover.in`) is copied into the build directory.

.. code-block:: text

   *clover
   state 1 density=0.2 energy=1.0
   state 2 density=1.0 energy=2.5 geometry=cuboid xmin=0.0 xmax=5.0 ymin=0.0 ymax=2.0 zmin=0.0 zmax=2.0
   x_cells=10
   y_cells=2
   z_cells=2
   xmin=0.0
   ymin=0.0
   zmin=0.0
   xmax=10.0
   ymax=2.0
   zmax=2.0
   initial_timestep=0.04
   max_timestep=0.04
   end_step=75
   test_problem 1

   visit_frequency=10
   *endclover

Important variables to keep note of are:

 - ``state`` defines different areas with in the mesh, their shape, and the amount of initial energy deposited in them.
 - ``x_cells`` defines the number of cells in the x direction
 - ``xmin`` and ``xmax`` defines the spatial extents in the x direction for the problem
 - ``visit_freqency`` defines often the Strawman API is called

Kripke
^^^^^^
Kripke is a scalable deterministic neutron transport solver that has an embedded test problem.
More information about Kripke can be found at `https://codesign.llnl.gov/kripke.php <https://codesign.llnl.gov/kripke.php>`_.
Unlike the other two proxy-applications, Kripke does not have discrete time steps.
Instead, the simulation represents a single moment in time and the iterations converge to a solution for the problem.

The both the Strawman API calls and the data integration can be found in ``src/examples/proxies/kripke/Kripke/Sweep_Solver.cpp``.
Kripke is meant to study the efficiency of different loop orderings and memory layouts for different architectures which makes zero copying the data difficult.
Thus, the data is extracted each iteration.
Mesh data extraction can be found starting at line 20, and the API calls can be found at line 101.

Running Kripke
""""""""""""""
Kripke take many command line parameters, and there is an example script that is copied into the directory where Kripke is built.

.. code-block:: bash

  srun -n 8 kripke_par --procs 2,2,2 --zones 32,32,32 --niter 5 --dir 1:2 --grp 1:1 --legendre 4 --quad 4:4

The parameters that control the problem size and layout are:

  - ``--procs`` controls the layout of the MPI processes over the mesh. In the example, we launch 8 total MPI tasks and distribute them evenly in each coordinate direction. The cross product of this argument must equal the number of MPI tasks, e.g. 2x2x2 = 8. Another valid value for 8 MPI tasks is ``1,1,8``.
  - ``--zones`` controls the number of zones in each coordinate direction of the problem mesh. In this case, the total mesh size is 32^3, and the number of zones for each MPI task will be 16^3. This is simple zones / procs, e.g. 32/2, 32/2, 32/2.
  - ``--niter`` controls the number of iterations. Note: as the solver converges on a solution, the images will differ less and less.
